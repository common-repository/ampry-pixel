**The Best WordPress Plugin To Convert More Site Visitor Into Leads & Sales**

Ampry eliminates the need to higher a developer. You can easily set it up on your website within just a few minutes and will start to see the results right away!

Generate more leads, more sales, and more revenue from the traffic you already have. Engage your website visitors with user-friendly pop-ups, attention-grabbing top and bottom bars, subtle notifications, and native ad units in one platform, all without coding.

Ampry is designed to engage the right visitor (advanced user targeting), at the right moment (multiple trigger options, including site abandonment, page scroll, on click, and time on site), with the right message (various placement options and split testing functionality).

Everyday use cases include displaying conversion numbers or testimonials as social proof, adding pop-ups with special offers targeted at exiting visitors, and capturing user information using the integrated form capture and delivery function.

Ampry can be added to any website in minutes and has proven to drive increased conversion rates for content marketers, additional monetization revenue for bloggers and affiliates, and decreased CPAs for e-commerce stores and lead gen pages.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How much does Ampry cost =
Ampry starts at $39 a month.  Visit our (https://ampry.com/pricing "pricing page") to find the best plan for you.

= Do I need to know how to code? =
Nope! Installing Ampry is as easy as adding one line of code to your website.

= Will it slow down my website? =
Nope! After the initial ampry pixel fires, Ampry uses a process called asynchronous loading, allowing the browser to continue loading elements of your page while Ampry simultaneously runs your placements on our servers in the background.

= Can I change my plan? =
Of course! You can change plans or switch between monthly and annual billing inside of your account at anytime.

= Is there a website limit? =
No, you can run all of your websites through a single Ampry account. Billing is based on the 'Views' you get from your Ampry placements. (See next question to learn more about views.)

= What counts as a View? =
A view is counted when a Ampry placement is displayed on your site. E.G. When a user gets a pop up, that will be one view. If you also have a top bar on that same page, that would count as a view also.

= How do I contact support? =
You can email us at support@ampry.com

= Do you have a free trial? =
Yes!  We offer a risk-free, 7-day free trial. (https://app.ampry.com/signUp "**Click here**") to get started today!
